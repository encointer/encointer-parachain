# Upward/ Downward native-token transfers
Working example for `polkadot-v0.9.12` to transfer the native token from the relay-chain to the parachain
 via the `xcm-pallet`. The message format is very generic, hence the correct extrinsics for those transfers are shown below.

## Downwards Tx
Send from Alice on the relay chain to AliceStash on the parachain.
